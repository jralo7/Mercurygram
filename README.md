# Mercurygram

[Telegram](https://telegram.org) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. It’s superfast, simple and free.

This is an unofficial fork of [Telegram App for Android](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram), maintained by rebasing Mercurygram patches and forward-ported de-googling patches on top of upstream Telegram.

## Install

Mercurygram publishes two kinds of build. The tag shape tells you which:

| Channel | Tag shape | Example | Packages | When it ships |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Stable** | 4-part `X.Y.Z.M` (M ≥ 1) | `12.7.3.1` | stable only (`it.belloworld.mercurygram`) | Tagged release. Also goes to F-Droid / IzzyOnDroid. |
| **Snapshot** | 5-part `X.Y.Z.M.K` (M ≥ 1) | `12.7.3.1.42` | **both** stable and beta (`it.belloworld.mercurygram.beta`) | Every push to the `Mercurygram` branch (`beta.yml`). Snapshot of the next stable. |
| **Pre-stable** | 5-part `X.Y.Z.0.K` | `12.7.3.0.5` | **both** stable and beta (`it.belloworld.mercurygram.beta`) | After an upstream rebase, before the first `X.Y.Z.M` (M ≥ 1) stable for that upstream ships (`beta.yml`). |

Snapshots and pre-stable builds both publish two APKs per release: a Release-flavor APK that updates the stable package side and a Debug-flavor APK (filename infixed with `-debug`) that updates the `.beta` package side. Filenames: `Mercurygram-<tag>-<abi>.apk` (Release) and `Mercurygram-debug-<tag>-<abi>.apk` (Debug). Stable installs pull the Release APK via the in-app updater opt-in toggle; `.beta` installs pull the Debug APK.

Versions order naturally: `12.7.3.0.5 < 12.7.3.1 < 12.7.3.1.42 < 12.7.3.2`.

### One-click install via [Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/)

Open the link on your Android device and the app source pre-fills with the right release filter and package ID.

**Stable** — package `it.belloworld.mercurygram`. Tagged stable releases only.

[![Add Mercurygram to Obtainium](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/main/assets/graphics/badge_obtainium.png)](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect?r=obtainium://app/%7B%22id%22%3A%22it.belloworld.mercurygram%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMercurygram%2FMercurygram%22%2C%22author%22%3A%22Mercurygram%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Mercurygram%22%7D)

**Beta** — package `it.belloworld.mercurygram.beta`. Per-push snapshots (`X.Y.Z.M.K`, M ≥ 1) and pre-stable test builds (`X.Y.Z.0.K`).

[![Add Mercurygram Beta to Obtainium](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/main/assets/graphics/badge_obtainium.png)](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect?r=obtainium://app/%7B%22id%22%3A%22it.belloworld.mercurygram.beta%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMercurygram%2FMercurygram%22%2C%22author%22%3A%22Mercurygram%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Mercurygram%20Beta%22%2C%22additionalSettings%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22includePrereleases%5C%22%3A%20true%2C%20%5C%22filterReleaseTitlesByRegEx%5C%22%3A%20%5C%22%5E%5C%5C%5C%5Cd%2B%5C%5C%5C%5C.%5C%5C%5C%5Cd%2B%5C%5C%5C%5C.%5C%5C%5C%5Cd%2B%5C%5C%5C%5C.%5C%5C%5C%5Cd%2B%5C%5C%5C%5C.%5C%5C%5C%5Cd%2B%24%5C%22%7D%22%7D)

> **Stable users:** the in-app updater can be opted in to pre-release updates from **Settings → Mercurygram → Updates → Accept pre-release updates**. Enabling shows a warning dialog. Turning it back off while a pre-release is installed offers the matching 4-part stable as an update, rolling the install back. Installing a pre-release by other means (sideload, Obtainium) switches the toggle on by itself at the next update check, so it always reflects the channel you are actually on.

## Features

- Add ID in Profile Info
- Add a UnifiedPush screen (*Settings → Mercurygram → Notifications → UnifiedPush*) listing the installed distributors, with the registration state shown under the list until the chosen distributor answers with an endpoint. A distributor may be long-pressed to inspect recent UnifiedPush notification/decryption stats
- Set the [UnifiedPush WebPush gateway](#unifiedpush-webpush-gateway) on the same screen
- Offer a built-in "Google FCM" entry in the distributor list, for devices that have Play Services and no distributor app installed. It carries no Google library and needs no Firebase project (see [Google FCM without Google libraries](#google-fcm-without-google-libraries)). It is never selected automatically, and picking it warns about what Google gets to see
- Set the VAPID public key the built-in "Google FCM" entry signs with, on the same screen (shown only while that entry is selected), so its pushes can be routed through a self-hosted gateway instead of Mercurygram's
- Add toggle setting in Chat Settings to start video messages with rear-facing camera
- Add toggle setting in Chat Settings to hide keyboard on chat scroll
- Add toggle setting in Chat Setting to hide "All Chats" tab (feature from NekoX)
- Add administrators item in group/channel info
- Add toggle setting in Debug Menu to enable Message Details menu
- Add toggle setting in Debug Menu to disable Unified Push support
- Add toggle setting in Debug Menu to disable Secure Flags. This option must **only** be used for debugging
- Add toggle setting in Debug Menu to remove sponsored messages and proxy sponsor banners. This option must **only** be used for debugging
- Re-add Monet themes ([#31](https://github.com/Mercurygram/Mercurygram/pull/31))
- Disabled DOH resolving since this leaks your used proxy to Google and it's not needed since Android DNS over TLS should be used instead
- Unlock premium app icons for anybody
- Unlock 5 accounts (was 3) and remove premium check for number of accounts
- Telegram application icons are replaced with [hermes wing (Created by Anthony Ledoux from Noun Project)](https://thenounproject.com/icon/hermes-wing-3559879/)

### TF-originated de-googling patches

These patches were originally derived from the Telegram-FOSS effort, but Mercurygram now forward-ports and rebases them directly onto upstream Telegram.

*Replacement of non-FOSS, untrustworthy or suspicious binaries or source code:*
- Do location sharing with OpenStreetMap via MapLibre instead of Google Maps
- Use Noto emoji set instead of Apple's emoji
- Google/Firebase push services replaced with [UnifiedPush](https://unifiedpush.org)
- **SECURITY:** BoringSSL, FFmpeg, libvpx, dav1d, and tde2e are built from source at compile time instead of shipping upstream prebuilts

*Removal or stubbing of non-FOSS, untrustworthy or suspicious binaries or source code and their functionality:*
- Google Play Services / Firebase dependencies from the default Mercurygram build and manifests
- Google Maps / Fused Location providers are stubbed out and replaced by MapLibre / Android location providers
- Google Wallet, SafetyNet, Play Integrity, and related proprietary verification pieces are stubbed out through local compatibility classes. Google Play Billing is gone as well, so Telegram Premium, gifts and Stars are paid for through Telegram's own invoice and card form (the same one bots use), not through the Play Store. The Google Pay button of that form is the only part that is missing
- Google Cast integration
- Google ML Kit / Google Vision integrations, including barcode and face detection paths
- Android passkey support is disabled as Telegram servers verify the APK signature, which fails for unofficial forks

*Other:*
- Added the ability to parse locations from intents containing a `geo:<lat>,<lon>,<zoom>` string
- Force static map previews from Telegram
- No content restrictions

### Privacy & anti-tracking (Mercurygram-only)

Mercurygram adds MTProto-layer mitigations that upstream Telegram and Telegram-FOSS do not ship:

- **Reduce network tracking** — opt-in toggle at *Settings → Mercurygram → Privacy*. Defends against the passive `auth_key_id` fingerprint described in the OCCRP / Symbolic Software review of May 2026 ([review-confirms-telegram-tracking-vulnerability](https://www.occrp.org/en/news/review-confirms-telegram-tracking-vulnerability)). MTProto's outer obfuscation2 stream cipher is recoverable from on-wire bytes (the AES-CTR keys are derived from the visible 64-byte TCP-handshake bytes via a public algorithm), so a passive observer with a full pcap from connection start can decode the obfuscation and read the 8-byte `auth_key_id` at the front of every MTProto frame. That id is stable enough to correlate a device across IP/network changes even though message contents stay encrypted. When the toggle is on:
  - Every default-network change (Wi-Fi ↔ cellular, VPN flip, IP rebind) forces a fresh PFS temp-key handshake so `auth_key_id` rotates across network boundaries (`MgNetworkChangeWatcher` + native `ConnectionsManager::rotateTempAuthKeys()`).
  - The CDN-redirect (`upload.fileCdnRedirect`) path is refused once per file download and the request is reissued against the main DC, keeping the long-lived permanent `auth_key_id` (which CDN nodes use because PFS is off there) off the wire.
  - `TEMP_AUTH_KEY_EXPIRE_TIME` is shortened from 24 h to 1 h via a runtime variable, with a `1h → 6h → 24h` ladder that bumps the TTL on a `bindTempAuthKey` `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE_INVALID` rejection — protects against a future server-side policy tightening without logging the user out (when the ladder exhausts the toggle auto-disables). Probed lower bound on DC2 in 2026-05 is 60 s; 1 h leaves a 60× safety margin. See [`scripts/probe-temp-key-ttl.py`](scripts/probe-temp-key-ttl.py) to re-measure the floor after a rebase.
- **Hidden accounts** — additional accounts can be marked hidden behind the existing passcode (*Settings → Mercurygram → General → Hidden accounts*); they don't appear in the account switcher when the passcode is locked.
- **Anti-delete & anti-edit message history** — opt-in per-account (*Settings → Mercurygram → General → Save deleted & edited messages*). Server-deleted messages, including your own messages the other side deleted, stay in the chat as a grayed-out ghost (a ghost can be removed with the usual Delete, and messages you delete yourself are not kept); edited messages keep all previous versions accessible from the message menu. Self-destructing / TTL / secret-chat messages are never recorded (api/terms §1.4).
- **De-googled UnifiedPush + WebPush** — no Google Play Services / Firebase Cloud Messaging anywhere in the binary; push notifications use [UnifiedPush](https://unifiedpush.org) with end-to-end WebPush encryption (`aesgcm` Draft 4 — decrypted locally; the gateway only sees ciphertext). See [UnifiedPush WebPush gateway](#unifiedpush-webpush-gateway).
- **DoH resolving disabled** — upstream Telegram falls back to Google DoH when normal DNS fails, which leaks the user's proxy/IP to Google. Mercurygram drops that path; Android's system DNS-over-TLS handles the same encryption-in-transit need without the leak.
- **Native crypto built from source** — BoringSSL, FFmpeg, libvpx, dav1d, and tde2e are compiled from source at build time instead of shipping upstream prebuilts (no opaque third-party binaries in the APK).

## Notes

In order to have reliable notifications, it may be necessary to set battery
optimization to **Not optimized** for Mercurygram (no, it won't use more battery).

Background Connections setting is not necessary and uses lot of battery, so
please disable it when you use UnifiedPush.

The converse also holds: if you turn UnifiedPush off (*Settings → Mercurygram →
Notifications → UnifiedPush → Disable UnifiedPush*), nothing pushes to the app any more, so
enable Background Connection or Keep-Alive Service in *Settings → Notifications
and Sounds* if you still want messages while the app is closed.

If you set Battery optimization to Not optimized, Keep-Alive Service will be not
necessary.

See [dontkillmyapp](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) for more information.

If you can't/want set Battery optimization to Not optimized and you don't
receive notifications after a while (more than 30 minutes) please enable
both Keep-Alive Service and Background Connection instead (Keep-Alive only
keeps the app running; Background Connection is what receives the messages).

## UnifiedPush WebPush gateway

Mercurygram uses Telegram's WebPush notifications through UnifiedPush.

When the app registers with a UnifiedPush distributor, it generates its own WebPush keypair and auth secret, then sends Telegram a WebPush token in JSON form:

```json
{"endpoint":"https://<gateway>/aesgcm?e=<distributor-endpoint>","keys":{"p256dh":"...","auth":"..."}}
```

Telegram encrypts notifications with WebPush `aesgcm` (Draft 4) and sends them to the configured gateway. The gateway forwards them to the chosen UnifiedPush distributor while embedding the `Encryption` and `Crypto-Key` headers into the request body, because UnifiedPush distributors do not preserve arbitrary HTTP headers.

Mercurygram then decrypts the payload locally and passes the MTProto notification payload to Telegram's normal notification pipeline. If decryption fails, it falls back to a wake-up notification path.

The gateway is configurable from Notifications and Sounds. Mercurygram currently defaults to https://p2p.belloworld.it/.

## Google FCM without Google libraries

Users who do not want to install a distributor app can pick the built-in
**Google FCM** entry in the distributor menu, on devices that have Play
Services. No Google library, dependency or Firebase project is involved: the
[embedded FCM distributor](https://codeberg.org/UnifiedPush/android-embedded_fcm_distributor)
only sends an intent to Play Services, which answers with a plain WebPush
endpoint. This is the same mechanism the Mastodon and SchildiChat Android apps
ship through F-Droid.

FCM accepts a push to such an endpoint only if it carries a
[VAPID](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8292) signature, which Telegram does
not send, so the endpoint registered with Telegram is the gateway's `/fcm/`
route. The gateway folds the `aesgcm` headers into the body exactly as above,
signs the request, and forwards it to FCM. Payloads stay end-to-end encrypted:
neither the gateway nor Google can read them.

What changes with this entry selected is metadata: Google learns that a
notification was delivered to the device, and Play Services must remain
installed. Every other distributor keeps Google out of the path entirely, which
is why this entry is never picked automatically and shows a warning when
selected. The `/fcm/` route follows the Gateway URL setting, and the gateway's
VAPID public key sits next to it on the same screen, so self-hosters can point
the entry at their own `aesgcm-proxy`. The two only work as a pair: a gateway
that does not hold the matching private half signs with a key FCM does not know,
and every push is rejected, so change both together or leave both alone.

> **Note:** `ntfy.sh` (the public hosted instance) does not work through
> the default Mercurygram gateway at `https://p2p.belloworld.it/`.
> That gateway is hosted on OCI infrastructure, and its IP is repeatedly
> blocked by `ntfy.sh` due to connection volume. The production nginx
> in front of the gateway short-circuits `ntfy.sh` endpoints with an
> immediate 201 response instead of proxying them.
> If you want to use `ntfy`, prefer a self-hosted instance.

Two self-hostable gateway implementations are included in this repository:

- [Python](https://github.com/Mercurygram/Mercurygram/tree/Mercurygram/Gateways/Python)
- [Rust](https://github.com/Mercurygram/Mercurygram/tree/Mercurygram/Gateways/Rust)

The public Rust instance only accepts Telegram server IP ranges (https://core.telegram.org/resources/cidr.txt) to reduce abuse.

## Why the name Mercurygram?

For a couple of reasons:

- Mercury is the Roman, and I'm Italian, God and the "**messenger** of the gods"
- The logo is a stylized 'F' representing his winged shoes, but it also resembles an 'F' in honor of **Freddy Mercury**.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution guide. **Translations
of the Mercurygram-only strings are especially welcome** — translators do not
need to know the codebase, just edit the relevant
`TMessagesProj/src/main/res/values-<locale>/strings.xml` and open a PR. Run
`./scripts/check-mg-translations.sh` to see which keys are still missing per
locale.

## Versioning

Tag shape encodes the release channel (see the [Install](#install) section for the table):

- **Stable** — `X.Y.Z.M` (4-part, `M ≥ 1`). `X.Y.Z` is the upstream Telegram version; `M` is the Mercurygram minor revision on top of it. Goes to the `it.belloworld.mercurygram` package, F-Droid, IzzyOnDroid.
- **Snapshot** — `X.Y.Z.M.K` (5-part, `M ≥ 1`). Per-push automated build between stable `X.Y.Z.M` and `X.Y.Z.(M+1)`. `K` is per-stable-bump monotonic. Goes to the `it.belloworld.mercurygram.beta` package and (for opted-in stable installs) the `it.belloworld.mercurygram` package.
- **Pre-stable** — `X.Y.Z.0.K` (5-part, `M = 0`). Per-push automated build issued between an upstream rebase and the first `X.Y.Z.M` (M ≥ 1) stable for that upstream. Lets testers exercise the upcoming stable before it gets the official 4-part tag. Stops being published once any `X.Y.Z.M` ≥ 1 stable exists for the current upstream. `M = 0` is the namespace marker — no `X.Y.Z.0` 4-part tag is ever created.

Pure lex compare on the dotted integer vector (shorter padded with zero) gives the right chronology: `12.7.3.0.5 < 12.7.3.1 < 12.7.3.1.42 < 12.7.3.2`.

`MgUpdateChecker` reads the GitHub tag from `PackageInfo.versionName` — the manifest carries the tag verbatim (see `gradle/mg-version.gradle`), so the canonical tag is available for every install path (in-app updater, sideload, F-Droid).

## Building

**NOTE: Building on Windows is, unfortunately, not supported.
Consider using a Linux VM or dual booting.**
![WindowsSupport](/tgfoss-build-under-win.gif?raw=true)

**Prerequisites:** Android SDK with the NDK version pinned by `ndkVersion` in `TMessagesProj/build.gradle`, JDK 17, `git`, and the native toolchain the media libraries need: [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/), [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) (dav1d), `nasm` (x86 assembly in libvpx, ffmpeg and openh264), `make`, `cmake` and `pkg-config`. `curl` is needed too: the build installs the pinned Rust toolchain that `jni/prebuild/build_tlottie.sh` uses (see `TMessagesProj/jni/setup_rust.sh`), because upstream ships the tlottie and openh264 archives prebuilt and Mercurygram builds them from source instead.

Clone the repository (submodules are initialized automatically at build time):

```
git clone https://github.com/Mercurygram/Mercurygram.git
```

Build with Android Studio or from the command line:

```bash
# Fat APK (all ABIs)
./gradlew assembleAfatRelease

# Single-ABI APKs (F-Droid)
./gradlew assembleAfatFdArm32Release   # armeabi-v7a
./gradlew assembleAfatFdArm64Release   # arm64-v8a
./gradlew assembleAfatFdX86Release     # x86
./gradlew assembleAfatFdX86_64Release  # x86_64
```

Native libraries (FFmpeg, BoringSSL, libvpx, dav1d, tde2e) are built from source automatically on the first build and cached for subsequent runs.

If you want to publish a modified version of Telegram:
- You should get **your own API key** here: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id and create a file called `API_KEYS` in the source root directory.
  The contents should look like this:
  ```
  APP_ID = 12345
  APP_HASH = aaaaaaaabbbbbbccccccfffffff001122
  ```
- Do not use the name Telegram and the standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial
- Take good care of your users' data and privacy
- **Please remember to publish your code too in order to comply with the licenses**
